### Hurricane Prediction Model Using Artificial Intelligence

**Project Overview:**
This repository features the development and resources of my Final Year Project aimed at revolutionizing hurricane forecasting through cutting-edge artificial intelligence. The project's primary goal was to devise a highly accurate AI-driven system for predicting hurricane trajectories and intensities, surpassing the capabilities of conventional forecasting models.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Analysis and Manipulation:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive data visualizations and real-time updates on the website)
- **Dataset:** Integrates historical hurricane data with real-time meteorological feeds for dynamic and predictive modeling

**Key Features:**
1. **Advanced AI Forecasting Models:** Leverages complex neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent structures, to predict hurricane paths and intensity.
2. **Real-Time Data Integration:** Employs real-time data alongside historical datasets to enhance predictive accuracy and response times.
3. **Interactive Web Interface:** Features a user-friendly website that displays real-time predictions, data visualizations, and model insights.

**Project Outcomes:**
- Achieved significant enhancements in forecasting accuracy, contributing to improved emergency management and disaster preparedness.
- Created a scalable and adaptable AI framework suitable for various meteorological forecasting tasks.

**Repository Contents:**
- `models/`: Trained models and their configurations.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the data analysis, modeling, and validation processes.
